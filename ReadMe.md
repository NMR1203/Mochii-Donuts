# mochii donuts:
donuts made with mochico(sweet rice flour)
this recipe usually takes from 15-25 mins
creates around 4 donuts per batch so I recommend x2

these donuts are about the size of the palm of a hand
__NOT BIG LIKE IN MOST STORES__

half the sugar if you are doing anything except plain
most fruit flavored yougurt has lots of sugar, so it becomes too sweet otherwise

the pankake mix acts as a starch or flour to protect your hands from how sticky the dough is

the longer the dough sits out, the stickier it gets *you have been warned*
the dough is 100% safe to eat. If you want to eat some as you make them feel free
